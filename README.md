# Hello-World
I build a number of SharePoint (2010/2013/2019) lab environments on super slim virtual environments. 
In an effort to maximize performance and reduce latency in these slim environments, I have spent the time to automate the discovery of the recommended anti-virus exclusions (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/952167). I generally do not utilize 3rd party antivirus software and can get away with Windows Defender - this script adds the discovered exclusions to Windows Defender when the defender parameter is used.
